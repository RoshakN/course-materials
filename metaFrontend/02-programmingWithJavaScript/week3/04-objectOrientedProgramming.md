# Object Oriented Programming

OOP or Object oriented programming is a paradigm used in many programming languages including JavaScript. OOP revolves around the idea of organizing our programs using objects to group related data and functionality.

In functional programming, we declare variables and functions separately, but in OOP we can declare an object with multiple properties including methods (functions).

OOP can make replicating real world objects and their attributes easier.
