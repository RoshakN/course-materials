# Functional Programming

In programming, there are 2 major styles of writing code. Of course there are other methods such as Procedural Programming, but the main 2 methods are:

1. Functional Programming (FP)
2. Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

Object Oriented Programming will be discussed later on.

No matter how you write the code, the result can still be the same, that is why FP and OOP are called `styles`.

There is a clear distinction between data and functions in functional programming as data can exist outside of functions.

In Functional Programming `Data` and `Function` are separated.

One of the main advantages of FP is that the return of a fucntion can be used inside another function.

All functions as a default return `undefined` value if not specifically told to return something. For example the `console.log()` method doesn't have a set value and just logs something to the console.

But if we do specify a return value, that value can be used in other functions.
