Hello everyone!

It's nice to meet you all. I'm a newbie web developer from Iran. I've been working in the book industry for the past 8 years, but finally decided to go where my heart desires and started learning web development.

I hope to become a great web developer and maybe even a blockchain developer in the future (as I am very intrigued by the concept) and that is why I enrolled in this course.

I will try to build a few small web-based game projects like tic-tac-toe and pig-game and then move onto more advanced topics.
