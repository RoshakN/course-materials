# Maps In JavaScript

Map in JavaScript is a data structure we can use to map values to keys.

Maps are somewhat like Objects in JS, but with a big difference. Objects can only have `string` keys, but the key in a map can be any data type, including `string`, `object`, or even other `map`s.

## How To Create A Map

Creating maps in JavaScript is relatively easy and like creating sets. The syntax is:

```js
const restaurant = new Map();
```

The easiest way to create a map is to actually make an empty map, like above, and then add properties to it.
