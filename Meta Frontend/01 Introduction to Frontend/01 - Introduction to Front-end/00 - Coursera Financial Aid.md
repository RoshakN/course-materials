# First Part
I am writing this to apply for financial aid and to be able to participate in the  <span style="color: red">first</span> course from Meta Front-end Specialization on Coursera. As a self-taught junior web developer in Iran, I am passionate about gaining the knowledge needed to become better at programming and development.

Until one month ago, I worked full-time as a content specialist employee in Iran. Before that I was in the book industry and have translated and published several books. I also studied Electronics Engineering at the university of Shiraz (my birthplace).

Since the education system isn't ideal in Iran, it took me many years and working in several fields to finally realize my real passion lies with programming and development. I've started self-learning web development and have already learned some HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but to fill the gap in my knowledge and successfully change my career, I need a properly designed program. After thorough research, I've decided that Meta Front-end Specialization offers just that and is perfect for me.

For this reason I've decided to participate in the 9 courses of the Meta Specialization, but considering the fact that each dollar in Iran is equivalent to about 50 thousand Tomans and I have a monthly salary of 130 dollars, I'm not able to pay for the courses on my own. This is why I am applying for financial aid. Without financial aid, it will be nearly impossible for me to afford the Meta Front-end Specialization, which I believe is the best option for me to gain the skills and knowledge I need as a front-end developer. With financial aid, I can actually focus on my studies without worrying about the high cost of living in Iran with a normal salary.

# Second Part
I am currently changing my career from content creation to web development, but since I don't have a university degree in computer science or programming, in order to work in an industry that I've always loved and also progress in it, I need a good and comprehensive Specialization Certificate to convince potential employers of my abilities.

Of course I will build an acceptable portfolio to accompany it, and hopefully get a better job. I aspire to be a good Front-end developer in the future and develop responsive and beautifully engineered web pages that satisfy both the employer and the users.

The training courses in Iran are not according to universal principles, and I came to the conclusion that this specialization and the 9 courses in it would help me immensely to achieve my dreams and validate my CV and portfolio, while teaching me real life experiences of the field and how to actually design a website from the ground up.

I believe the future would hugely be affected by programming in general and web development is one of the most important fields of it. With the help of this financial aid I will not only do what I love for a living, but also be able to participate in and be a part of the future.
