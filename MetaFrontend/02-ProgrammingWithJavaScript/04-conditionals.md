# Conditionals and Loops

The most common conditional statement is the `if` statement. It workes by deciding if the condition described in the statement is `true` or `false`.

```js
if (condition == true) {
  console.log("Condition is true");
}
```

The `if` conditional statement also has other options like `else` and `else if`.

```js
const variable1 = 16;
if (variable > 30) {
  console.log("Variable is too big.");
} else if (variable < 10) {
  console.log("Variable is too small.");
} else {
  console.log("Variable is just right.");
}
```
